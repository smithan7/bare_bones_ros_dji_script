Hookup the matrice to linux computer ( that will be controlling the matrice ) and the windows computer running the simulator

start the simulator on the windows computer

put the matrice controller in 'F' mode

allow the simulator to find and set home

on the linux computer:

	- in a terminal cd to catkin_ws
		- source devel/setup.bash
		- roslaunch dji_sdk sdk_manifold.launch

	- in a NEW terminal cd to catkin_ws
		- catkin_make
		- source devel/setup.bash
		- rosrun rags_dji_side rags_dji_side.py


Then a few things should happen
	- The matrice should take-off fly away for a few seconds and then return home to land
	- The terminal running 'rags_dji_side.py' should be printing a lot of info.
		- It's printing location in local/global frames, rc input

	- You should be able to go through my code (/script/rags_dji_side.py) and see how the mission was created.

Subscribing to more topics
	- To setup subscribers you will need to start a new terminal
		- rostopic list
		- pick a topic you want to subscribe to; e.g. "/dji_sdk/odometry"
		- get topic info
			- rostopic info /dji_sdk/odometry
			- gives type nav_msgs/Odometry
		- get topic structure
			- rostopic echo /dji_sdk/odometry
	
	- in your python script
		- import library in script
			- nav_msgs.msg import Odometry
		- define subscriber
			- rospy.Subscriber("/dji_sdk/odometry", Odometry, callback_odom)
		- write callback function
			- def callback_odom(data):
				print("got odom position: ", data.pose.pose.position )
				print("got odom orientation: ", data.pose.pose.orientation )
